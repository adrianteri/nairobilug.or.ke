Summary: Highlights from the July, 2017 meetup.

We had a meetup on 8th July 2017 at Ona where Ibrahim Ng'eno gave a talk on
letsencrypt and certbot ssl certificates.

He demonstrated generating an SSL certificate with auto updating specifically
for Apache from buying the domain name to having it hosted and SSL working in
15 minutes.

We also discussed picking the best configs and ciper suite and also best
practice for web servers in the end the cert had an A scrore on [ssl labs]

Turns out you also get access to nice client side features once you have SSL
such as browser notifications.
